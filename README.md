## WHAT IS THIS?
Seatbelt is an emergency escape plan against hostile players online.

For example, delivering cargo or making sales in a public session gives you a bonus for each player in the session.  
If you see an incoming MKII, or hear you are being locked onto by a homing missile, you can then activate Seatbelt to freeze and unfreeze your GTA.exe process.
By doing this, it will automatically put you in an empty public solo session, removing all threats.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download the **Seatbelt.exe** and **pssuspend.exe**
2. Place them anywhere in the same directory
3. Run the Seatbelt.exe
4. Open GTA
5. PRESS **NUMPAD 0** to activate Seltbelt and freeze the GTA.exe process
6. GTA.exe will be unfrozen automatically after 10 seconds
7. You will now be in an empty session
